# Project Euler - Python Solutions

This book is an environment for testing and share my solutions for the problems provided by [Project Euler][euler-url].

*Note: This book is only in the beginning stages. New problems/solutions will be periodically added.*

## Author

This book is provided by [Dr Patricia Ternes][ternes-url].

## Contributing

If you want to contribute in any way, like

- Fix an error
- Improve code
- Add new solution possibilities & benchmarking

please, use the [GitHub Issues][issues-url].

## Creating solutions

There are multiple ways of solving problems. Here, I am providing the solution that I created.

If you would like to try your own solutions, please launch the problem page using Colab or Binder and then give a try.
Every problem has a testing unite, so you can test your code.

Finally, it is possible to create an account in the [Project Euler][euler-url] page to add and track solutions.
